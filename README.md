# Creative Coding: The Nature of Code Sketches

This repository contains some of my creative coding sketches inspired by Daniel Shiffman's book, "The Nature of Code".

## About
This project is a personal collection of code experiments, visualizations, and generative art based on the concepts and exercises from the book. Each sketch explores a different topic, such as vectors, forces, oscillation, particle systems, and more. The book suggests plenty of sketches design, but I have only included the coolest ones ;)


## How to View the Sketches

You can view each sketch live in your browser using GitHub Pages:

1. Visit: `https://feli-ohl.github.io/Creative-Coding/`
2. Browse to the `sketches` folder and select a sketch (e.g., `paint-splatter` or `perlin-noise-walker`).
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the sketch in action.

**Direct links:**
- [Paint Splatter](https://feli-ohl.github.io/Creative-Coding/sketches/paint-splatter/)
- [Perlin Noise Walker](https://feli-ohl.github.io/Creative-Coding/sketches/perlin-noise-walker/)

### Run Locally
You can also download the repository and open any sketch's `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
