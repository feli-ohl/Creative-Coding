# Creative Coding: The Nature of Code Sketches

This repository contains some of my creative coding sketches inspired by Daniel Shiffman's book, "The Nature of Code".

## About
This project is a personal collection of code experiments, visualizations, and generative art based on the concepts and exercises from the book. Each sketch explores a different topic, such as vectors, forces, oscillation, particle systems, and more. The book suggests plenty of sketches design, but I have only included the coolest ones ;)



## How to View the Sketches

You can view all sketches live in your browser using the custom homepage:

1. Go to: [https://feli-ohl.github.io/Creative-Coding/](https://feli-ohl.github.io/Creative-Coding/)
2. Click on any sketch to open and interact with it instantly.

Or, download the repository and open any sketch's `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
