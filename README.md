# Creative Coding: The Nature of Code Sketches

Welcome! This repository contains my creative coding sketches inspired by Daniel Shiffman's book, "The Nature of Code".

## About
This project is a personal collection of code experiments, visualizations, and generative art based on the concepts and exercises from the book. Each sketch explores a different topic, such as vectors, forces, oscillation, particle systems, and more.

## Structure
- `sketches/` — All code sketches, organized by chapter or topic.
- `README.md` — This file.

## How to Use
Browse the `sketches` folder to see the different projects. Each sketch will have its own subfolder with code and a brief description.

## Credits
- Inspired by [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) by Daniel Shiffman
